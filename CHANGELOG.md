### Added

- Experimental generative transcript summarization provides a short paragraph with a synopsis of each completed call; use the built-in summarization model which runs on Amazon Sagemaker, or use Anthropic's Claude API with 100K token limit (eliminating transcript length limitations), or experiment with custom language models or APIs of your choice. See [Transcript Summarization](./README.md#optional-generative-ai-call-summarization)
- User Interface updated to use the [Cloudscape](https://cloudscape.design/) framework with improved functionality and appearance.

## [0.5.2] - 2023-05-25

### Fixed

- Update Lambdas from Node.js 12x to 14x (12.x is deprecated)

## [0.5.1] - 2023-05-15

### Fixed

- Cloudformation stack failing due to recent S3 bucket changes on ACLs #163 #165

## [0.5.0] - 2023-03-23

### Added

- Option to deploy Advanced reporting and analytics for the Post Call Analytics (PCA) solution with Amazon QuickSight
- Supports Transcribe Custom Language Models (CLM)

## [0.4.0] - 2022-11-27

### Added

- Supports ingestion of post-call output transcripts from Transcribe Real-time Call Analytics.
- Supports integration with Live Call Analytics and Agent Assist (LCA) v0.6.0 or later. See [LCA Integration](./README.md#live-call-analytics-and-agent-assist-companion-solution)

## [0.3.4] - 2022-11-9

### Added

- Additional processing for Genesys CTR telephony files. See [Integration with Telephony CTR Files](./README.md#integration-with-telephony-ctr-files)
  - Handling the same agent being on the call multiple times
  - Removing entities from lines tagged as being from the IVR
  - Extraction of header-level metadata from Genesys in a new Telephony results header block

### Fixed

- lag on Call Detail UI page reload for long calls
- refactored code to incorporate witch lambda layer source in the repo instead of downloading prebuild zip file

## [0.3.3] - 2022-09-14

### Fixed

- SFProcessTurn causing CREATE_FAILURE and stack rollback. This was caused by the Sept 10 release of the FFMPEG v5.1.1 distribution which had a larger size than the earlier version, resulting in the FFMPEG Lamba Layer exceeding the max size allowed by the Lambda service. To avoid this issue, the main stack CloudFormation parameter `ffmpegDownloadUrl` now defaults to the v4.4 distribution instead of 'latest'.
- Reduce Lambda function failure rate when processing very large audio files:
  - Increase multiple PCA server lambda function memory allocation to make functions run faster, and increase timeouts to reduce liklihood of timeouts when processing large audio files.
  - Increase empheral storage for 'StartTranscribeJob' lambda to accomodate S3 download and temp storage of large audio files.

## [0.3.2] - 2022-08-24

### Fixed

- PCA Workflow failure with KMS encrypted recordings caused by the new `SFPostCTRProcessing` Lambda function role not included in KMS Key policy. Function role now included in the `RolesForKMSKey` output.
- CopyObject AccessDenied issue when using BulkMove with recording files that have S3 tags.

## [0.3.1] - 2022-08-23

### Fixed

- Support nested folders in bulk workflow

## [0.3.0] - 2022-08-12

### Added

- Initial processing for Genesys CTR telephony files. See [Integration with Telephony CTR Files](./README.md#integration-with-telephony-ctr-files)

### Fixed

- Stack outputs `RolesForKMSKey` - Replace incorrect function ARN with Role Arn for BulkMoveFiles, and added BulkFilesCount

## [0.2.5] - 2022-07-05

### Fixed

- Stack failure when 'loadSampleAudioFiles`set to`false`

## [0.2.4] - 2022-06-10

### Fixed

- Use sigv4 for S3 presignedURLS
- New stack output with list of role ARNS thta need access KMS key (if any) used to encrypt S3 InputBucket, OutputBucket, or BulkUploadBucket

## [0.2.3] - 2022-06-09

### Fixed

- Simplifies workflow by using new Transcribe API to specify Custom Vocabulary and Vocabulary Filter at the same time as using Language ID.

## [0.2.2] - 2022-06-01

### Fixed

- Replaces ':' with '-' when constructing Transcribe job name. Note, use '-' instead of ':' in any custom regex patterns specified in CF parameter, as regex is applied to the generated job name after replacement.

## [0.2.1] - 2022-04-20

### Fixed

- supports audio files placed in subfolders under IngestBucket path. Replaces '/' with '-' when constructing job name.

## [0.2.0] - 2022-03-22

### Added

- add support for Transcribe Call Analytics call summarization (ActionItems, Outcomes)

### Fixed

- fix "Load more" button on PCA Home page

## [0.1.4] - 2022-03-06

### Fixed

- fix content security policy for S3 bucket url used to access recordings in the UI for non us-east-1 regions
- add new Filename Regex to keep track of calls from a particular Customer, or a caller's name or ID. Similar to AGENT and GUID. This also adds the additional structure to the pca glue catalog, so that a query can be used to group calls by CUST.
- add CloudFormation parameter pattern rules to defend against reported instances of browser autofill populating BulkUploadStepFunctionName and ConversationLocation parameters with user's first & last name, causing subsequent stack failure.
- merge dependabot PRs

## [0.1.3] - 2022-02-19

### Fixed

- Fix deployment failure for regions other than us-east-1
- Fix template validation failures when publishing in regions where Amazon Kendra is not supported

## [0.1.2] - 2022-01-14

### Fixed

- Specify a manifest-src in the content security policy.
- Fix broken image link in call detail page for recordings processed by Transcribe standard (not Call Analytics)

## [0.1.1] - 2022-01-07

### Fixed

- Athena queries broken due to image storage path
- Recordings processed by Transcribe standard (not Call Analytics) fail to show up in the UI

## [0.1.0] - 2021-12-17

### Added

- Initial release
