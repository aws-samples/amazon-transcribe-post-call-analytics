#### Why do we need Post-Call Analytics?!

The AWS CCI Post-Call Analytics solution helps drive deeper quality management insights through automatic analysis of contact-center conversations, generating actionable insights such as product and service feedback loops that can be used to benefit the rest of the organization, or the best performing interactions such as those ending with a positive sentiment score.

Typical areas of information that an organization's contact centers needs to know of their customers, and why they need it, are:

| ![Who are you](./images/who-are-you.png) | ![What do you need](./images/what-do-you-need.png) | ![How did we do](./images/how-did-we-do.png) | ![Where can we improve](./images/where-to-improve.png) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Who are you?** | **What do you need?** | **How did we do?** | **Where can we improve?** |
| Accessing relevant customer data is crucial to problem resolution | Identifying problems correctly and efficiently impacts customer sentiment | Measuring how well the problem was handled and its impact on loyalty / retention | Analyzing the data to improve the customer experience and the bottom line |

Today every experience we face is defined by the best consumer experiences we know. We also judge all that we do with an unconscious bias, and invariably compare these to the brands we are loyal too. With an AI-enabled post-call analytics solution and your preferred Business Intelligence reporting tool you can answer these questions, which can then help you generate positive outcomes such as:

-   Improved quality management with contact center call resolution insights
-   More efficient call review process
-   Development of better scorecards to assess agent performance
-   Targetted agent training and reinforcement
