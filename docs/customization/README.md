#### Language service customisation 

The primary AWS AI services used in this application are Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Comprehend, and this application is able to not only take advantage of some of their standard features but is also able to support a number of their language cusomisation features. This section deals with how you can define a simple configuration for such customisations yet still support multiple languages.
