#### Application deployment 
The Post-Call Analytics solution is deployed using an AWS CloudFormation template, allowing you to quickly and easily install and configure the application. It also comes with a small number of sample contact center calls, which the solution can optionally deploy so that you immediately have some output transcripts and metadata to look at the first time you login to the application.
