"""
This python function is part of the bulk files workflow.  Checks the current state of the Transcribe job queue,
taking into account running and queued jobs.  It then returns the calculated head-space in the queue that the
Bulk process is able to use.  If any of the API calls to Transcribe or S3 get throttled then we say the queue
is full this cycle and carry on
